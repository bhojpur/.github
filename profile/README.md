# [Making Intelligent IT Solutions](https://www.bhojpur-consulting.com)

We encourage __free__ and __open source__ software development that establishes reasonable trust among customers. Also, it is
their `right to know`, what exactly is there under the hood in the technology __products__ or __services__ they are consuming.
Anyone can learn about the software by reviewing the `source code` at their own pace. You are free to __copy__ the source code
and encouraged to experiment and/or use it according to your situation.

We make web-scale, high-performance, distributed software `products` (e.g. `applications`, `platforms`, `APIs`) and `services`
targeting `decentralized` **digital enterprises** and **communication service providers** globally. We specialize in complex
system integration.

## Platform as a Service Development

We are continuously integrating, building, testing, and deploying [Bhojpur.NET Platform](https://github.com/bhojpur/platform)
ecosystem solutions to deliver high quality software and reliable systems to the clients. Some among these are available in a
cloud __hosted__ model. However, you have the freedom to download and __self-host__ the same in your own data center (i.e.
on-premise or public Cloud). We use multiple `cloud service providers` to host the solution for reliability and availability
reasons. Most of our solutions are cloud-aware, but definitely cloud agnostic.

## Custom Application Development

We engage with enterprise clients to develop `multi-tenant` software applications accessible through **mobile**, **web**, and
**desktop**. Such custom IT solutions are designed for high-performance, web-scale, apply decentralized architecture, integrate
well with market leading products or services or platform APIs, and leverage __pre-integrated__, __tested__, and __reliable__
[Bhojpur.NET Platform](https://github.com/bhojpur/platform) ecosystem solution capabilities. We can build custom IT solutions
very quickly due to our pre-integrated `frameworks` and `SDKs`.

## Support Services

We do offer multi-channel technical or customer support services related to our software frameworks, platform APIs, products
and/or services to paid subscribers through a [Global Support Centre](https://desk.bhojpur-consulting.com). It is accessible
on a 24x7 basis to the clients globally.

## Training Services

For easy technology adoption, we also provide __online__ [training](https://show.bhojpur-consulting.com) course delivery and
managed through our [Education Services](https://education.bhojpur-consulting.com) platform. These paid services are available
to clients globally.

## Partnership Program

We engage with `partners` (e.g., consulting, integration, hosting, support) to provide better technology experience and serve
our clients globally. We have setup a `software developer` program to encourage technology builders adopt our platform in their
products or services.
